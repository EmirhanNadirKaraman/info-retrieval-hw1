# info-retrieval-hw1

This is the first assignment of CS433 - Information Retrieval Systems. 

You can run the program with the following command: 

```pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py```

The results change ever so slightly, every time a model is trained from scratch.

BertEmbedder is commented out (in main.py) as it takes so much time to run. 
You can uncomment and run it for testing.
