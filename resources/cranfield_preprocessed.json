         "raw_text": "some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundary\nlayer flow .\n  the laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over a\ntwo-dimensional curved surface is investigated for two cases, one in\nwhich the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it is\ncases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations of\nmotion by an order-of-magnitude analysis .  these equations are\nsolved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressure\ngradient .  in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the\nsurface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are\nmodified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curved\nsurface .\n  the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the\nstress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while\nthe stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate .  the\nmost important effect of surface curvature, for the cases\nconsidered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile\nnear the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer .  the requirement\nthat a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the\npotential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to\nhave a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surface\ncurvature and a positive slope for concave surface curvature .",

         "raw_text": "an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation\nof airflow, particularly boundary layer flow at high\nreynolds numbers .\nand rapid method by which boundary\nlayer flow was rendered visible has been\npreviously described in the journal of the royal\naeronautical society .  it gave promise of\nbeing useful at the highest tunnel speeds provided\na denser smoke could be obtained, which at\nthe same time was free from the troublesome deposits\nassociated with the wood smoke .\nof the aerodynamics division attempts were made\nby the fuel research station to improve the\ndensity of the wood smoke and to reduce the\ndeposits .  these they showed were conflicting\nrequirements, and whilst some improvement\nwas effected, it was not sufficient for observation\nin the new tunnels at high speeds .\n  the staff of the director-general of scientific\nresearch and development, ministry of supply,\nwas then approached and it was decided to\ndevelop an oil smoke generator from a simple\ngenerator of this type which was demonstrated\nto us .  this has been done successfully .\nthe final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke\ngenerator is light and compact .  it takes\nonly a few minutes to start and can be run as long as desired .\nimprovement on the wood smoke both as regards\ndensity and freedom from deposits, which cause\npremature transition .  the density and quality\nof the smoke are now under control .  smokes\nranging from a light smoke of bluish white colour\nto a heavy smoke dense white in appearance\ncan be obtained .  the oil smoke retains the\nadvantages of the wood smoke in that it is\nnon-corrosive and non-irritant, and the smell can be\ntolerated even when it is present in a considerable\nconcentration .  a certain amount of condensation\nis inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable\nprecautions troubles arising from this can be\navoided .  a dry solid smoke made by melting a\nhard wax was successfully generated with the\nsame apparatus .  unfortunately because of its\nflocculent nature this smoke gave rise to solid\ndeposits when passed through bore tubing,\nleading eventually to complete blockage .  this\nseems to be a feature of solid smokes .\n  the apparatus has been used to determine\ntransition and laminar separation points on model\nwings in a number of the national physical\nlaboratory tunnels .  smoke filaments have been\nmaintained in the laminar state up to wind\nspeeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels .\n  there is much to be said for making a standard\npractice of visualising boundary layer flow on\nmodels, particularly as the technique is simple and\nrapid .  it would greatly assist the\ninterpretation of force measurements and the more detailed\nexplorations of the boundary layer by total\nhead tubes and hot wires .\n  the use of oil smoke is not limited to\nboundary layer flow visualisation .  the apparatus\ndescribed in this report would seem to be\nparticularly suited for educational work in small\ndemonstration tunnels .",

         "raw_text": "various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied\ngas flow .\n  this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous\naerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and\nat sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free\npath becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer\ntheory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .\n  results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to\ndefine the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of\ncontinuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental\nevidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a\nmodel, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this\nmodel may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in\ndetail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a\nreasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .\n  in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes\nof problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/\nclass, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction .\nfor the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the\nshock layer region between the shock and the body is fully\nviscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer\nare small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the\nnavier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given\nby the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer\nclass, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes\nequations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock\nstructure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary\nconditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/\nconditions where the shock may no longer be considered an\ninfinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened\nsufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this\ncase we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying\nconservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,\nand heat conduction .\n  for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes\nequations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for\nboth the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions\nof these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow\nproblems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to\nillustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations\nhave been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the\nassumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful\napproximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged\nlayer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere\nusing the incipient merged layer approximation .\n  results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,\nand heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled\nsphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds\nnumber, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above\nthe extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer\nregime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime .\nas the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged\nregime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static\nand stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .\n  calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with\ndecreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,\nthe density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy\nbehind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they\nare higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the\nstagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .\n  for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the\nsame quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase\nfound in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated\nboundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction\ntheory .\n  a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental\ndata for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and\nthe behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations .\nqualitative agreement is indicated .",

(for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same\nquart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .)\nthe stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in\ndetail .  the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion\nof stability due to heisenberg ..  if a velocity profile has an\nnumber and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same\nwave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds\nnumber is sufficiently large .  this destabilizing effect of\nviscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the\ngeneral stability theory,. its physical and mathematical\nsignificance is carefully discussed .\n  the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called\nneutral curve for the two characteristic types of\nvelocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and\nthe symmetrical profile .  the asymptotic behavior of the\nneutral curve is discussed first .  the main difference between\nprofiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two\nbranches of the neutral curve approach and for\nprofiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile\nwithout a flex .  the most important results are as follows .\nfor sufficiently large reynolds number r .  (2) there always\nexists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a\nsimilar result was obtained by synge from energy\nconsiderations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the\nmotion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the\nasymptotic behavior of the curves shows further\nthat there always exists a maximum value of a beyond\nwhich the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence\nthe qualitative shape of the curve is determined .\n  the author proceeds to show that simple approximate\nexpressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his\ngeneral analysis for a given velocity profile .  these\napproximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius\nflow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds\nnumbers are based on the width of the channel and the\ndisplacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method\nfor computing the complete instability curve is presented\nand the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked\nout in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been\ngiven before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more\nexact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far\nas the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned .\nthe value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for\npoiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the\nminimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the\nagreement with the estimate from the simple criterion\nmentioned above is thus very good .\n  a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous\neffects and of future developments concludes the paper .",

         "raw_text": "interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the\neffects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .\nthe interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important\neffects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been\nwritten as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical\nreview of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying\nphysical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to\nthe reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our\nknowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a\nfundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem\nis understood sufficiently well for design purposes .\npart i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types\nof flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the\n development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction\n depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of\nthe shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a\nlaminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if\nthe boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of\nthe interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences\nit is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the\ndifference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers\narises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in\nan adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream\n of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the\nseparated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the\nsurface .\nmany of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in\n practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of\nthe paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of\naerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the\ninteraction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and\nin supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences\nbetween the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are\noften a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and\nfull-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,\nfrequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial\nmeans . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of\nthe more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that\nexperiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a\nnumber of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and\nconnected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the\nturbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight\n and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a\ncertain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions\nfull-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if\nthe pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and\nthe trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information\n is at present available on this point .\nmost of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion\ncharacteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated\nreduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this\nis because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation\n between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge\nremains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock\n waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain\n unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface\nseparation .\nsome evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the\noccurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other\nrespects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .\nsome notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of\n the paper .",

         "raw_text": "ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone .\n  the analytic investigation of laminar combustion\nprocesses which are essentially two- or three-dimensional\npresent some mathematical difficulties .  there are,\nhowever, several examples of two-dimensional flame\npropagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in\ncomparison with that in the principal direction of flow .\nsuch examples occur in the problem of flame quenching\nby a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate,\ncombustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases\nthe problem may be simplified by employing what is\nknown in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer\napproximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his\ntreatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it\nconsists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is\nsmall, the variations of flow properties along the direction\nof main flow are small in comparison with those in a\ndirection normal to the main flow .  the analytic\ndescription of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present\nanalysis considers the ignition and combustion in the\nlaminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas\nstreams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible\nmixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two\nstreams come into contact at a given point and a laminar\nmixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is\nmodified by viscosity, and the temperature and\ncomposition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical\nreaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream\nis assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with\ntemperature dependence according to the arrhenius law .\nfor a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature\ndistribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does\nthe combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far\ndownstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear\nand what is the detailed process of development .  since\nthe hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition\nalways takes place at some point of the stream .  however,\nwhen the temperature of the hot stream drops below a\ncertain value, the distance required for ignition increases\nso enormously that it essentially does not occur in a\nphysical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete\ndevelopment of the laminar flame front is computed using\nan approximation similar to the integral technique\nintroduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .",

         "raw_text": "plastic stability theory of thin shells .\n  considerable interest is currently centered on the\nrole of deformation and flow types of plasticity\ntheories in the solution of stability problems .  for\nthin flat plates, deformation theory combined with\nclassical stability theory appears to yield results which\nare in substantially good agreement with test data .\non the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear\nto require the introduction of initial imperfections in\norder to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with\ntests .\n  thus, in view of the current state of development of\nplastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit\nthe mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation\ntheory in the investigation of the plastic stability of\nthin shells .  although there may be theoretical\nobjections to deformation theories as a class, test data on\nflat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results\nobtained from this theory .\n  in this paper, a set of equilibrium differential\nequations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant\nunequal radii is derived .  this set of three equations\napplies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any\nloading system leading to buckling .  for particular\nproblems such as buckling of cylinders under axial\ncompression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres\nunder external pressure, the set of equations can be\nreduced to a single eighth-order partial differential\nequation of the donnell type in terms of the radial\ndisplacement only .  these donnell-type equations are\nused to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres\nunder external pressure and long and moderate length\ncylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads .  the\nlimiting cases of a simply supported flat plate under\ncompression or shear, represent the solutions for short\ncylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively .",

         "raw_text": "on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel .\nthe performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock\ntechnique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and\nhigh-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to\ndisturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from\n the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for\nthat the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak\nenough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach\nnumber, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to\nremain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much\nlonger than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are\npredicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the\nexpansion wave originating at the diaphragm .\noutside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the\n arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first\ndisturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately\n equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the\ncontact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it\n appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation\nare confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a\nheated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for\nfurther analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the\nmultiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end\n of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach\nnumber . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected\ndisturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in\n theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number .\nexperiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to\nprovide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if\nallowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact\nsurface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and\ntransmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave\nreflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised\nsubstantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow\nduration may result .\na striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of\nthe tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is\nattributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its\ninteraction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further\nresearch is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the\neffects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of\nthe tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion\nwave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that\nthe arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a\nsevere limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock\nmach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow\nduration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to\nsuppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to\nhave alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over\na range of shock mach number .\nit is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock\nmach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach\nnumber of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using\nreflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because\nof the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and\nthe deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present\ninvestigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character .\nfurther research is required to check and extend the findings, and\ntopics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .",
